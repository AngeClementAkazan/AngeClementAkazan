### About me 🌱 
I am  Ange-Clément Akazan, a PhD student in mathematics working on enhancing model robustness in deep learning using probabilistic-constrained optimization. I am registered at the [University of Kwazulu Natal](https://ukzn.ac.za), and my research is funded by the [AIMS Research and Innovation Centre]([https://aims.ac.rw](https://aims.ac.rw/about-the-research-centre/)).

### Biography

✨ I am originally from [Côte d'Ivoire(Ivory Coast)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast), where I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics (2018) and a Master’s degree in Statistics (2021) from the  [University Félix Houphouët Boigny](https://w.univ-fhb.edu.ci). In September 2021, I moved to Kigali ([Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda)), to pursue a Master’s in Mathematical Sciences, specializing in Climate Sciences at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS Rwanda)](https://aims.ac.rw).
After completing my Master’s program, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for four months (August–November 2022). In December 2022, I began a role as a Research Assistant in generative AI. During this time, I also served as a Technical Support Assistant for the [Evidence-Based Climate Reporting (ECRI)](https://aims.ac.rw/2023/12/01/were-transforming-africa-through-innovative-scientific-training-technical-advances-and-breakthrough-discoveries/#:~:text=December%201%2C%202023-,The%20Evidence%20Based%20Climate%20Reporting%20Initiative%20(ECRI)%20Program%20had,its%20First%20Graduation%20in%202023!&text=methodologies.,based%20Climate%20Reporting%20(ECRI).&text=ECRI%20has%20three%20pillars%2C%20namely,and%20Work%2DIntegrated%20Learning%20program) program, focusing on small-scale data analysis using Excel (February–April 2023).
In September 2023, I was selected for a 4-month research internship funded by IVADO and AIMS, facilitated by [MILA-Quebec](https://mila.quebec/en). In March 2024, I began a doctoral program funded by the [AIMS Research and Innovation Centre]([https://aims.ac.rw](https://aims.ac.rw/about-the-research-centre/)), and I am currently registered at the [University of Kwazulu Natal](https://ukzn.ac.za).
